# ArcGISMapApp Sample

This repository contains a minimal SwiftUI application that demonstrates how to display an ArcGIS basemap and track the user's current location on iOS 18 using Swift 6.2, Xcode 26, and ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift 200.8. See [`ArcGISMapApp/README.md`](ArcGISMapApp/README.md) for setup details.
